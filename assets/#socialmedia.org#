Hi! My name is Ray, I have built a website [fictionhub.io](http://fictionhub.io) - I want it to become a great place for writers to share their stories, find the audience, and discover awesome fiction.
     
I have read your stories on /r/WritingPrompts, and now I'm a huge fan =) I think they are really briliant, exactly the kind of stuff I would love to see in our community, so I wanted to ask if you would agree to add them to fictionhub.

Your stories will be featured on the front page, and I expect that they'll be read by at least 12-15 thousand people during the next few months. Your profile will link to your [website/subreddit], and send you some readres and subscribers =)
 
I think our users will really enjoy reading your stories, and I would be extremely happy if you would agree to share them on fictionhub. Please let me know what you think!

Hi! My name is Ray, I have built a website [fictionhub.io](http://fictionhub.io) - I want it to become a great place for writers to share their stories, find the audience, and discover awesome fiction.
     
I have discovered your [story about life's difficulty level](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/4cmk5a/wp_you_just_got_fired_youre_pretty_sure_your/d1jkux5) on /r/WritingPrompts, I think it's really briliant, and I would really love to see it on fictionhub, so I want to ask if you [could give me permission  to post] [would like to publish] it there.

It will be featured on the front page, and I expect that it'll be read by at least 8-12 thousand people during the next few months. Your profile  will have a link to /r/MatiWrites, and send you some readers and subscribers =)
