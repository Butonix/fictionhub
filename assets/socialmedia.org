Hi! My name is Ray, I am the author of a website fictionhub[dot]io - I want it to become a great place for writers to share their stories, find the audience, and discover awesome fiction.

I have recently read "[Pulse]", and I thought it was absolutely brilliant and awesome. It is exactly the kind of story I would like to see in our community, so I wanted to ask if you would like to publish it on to Fiction Hub(with a link to the original story and to your profile). The story would be shared with our subscribers, and I expect it will be read by at least 8-12 thousand people during the next few months. 

I think our users would really enjoy reading your story, and I would be extremely happy if you would agree to share it with our community. Please let me know what you think! =)

Also, if you have some time - it would be amazing if you could let me know what you think about the website. I want it to be the perfect place for people like you to share stories and hang out, so if you have any thoughts or feedback about it - it would really help me to improve this project.
